		<h1>Time Estimation Tool for Software Projects Management</h1>
		Accurate time estimation is a skill essential for good project management. It is important to get time estimates right
		for two main reasons:
		
		Time estimates drive the setting of deadlines for delivery and planning of projects, and hence will impact on other
		peoples assessment of your reliability and competence as a project manager.
		Time estimates often determine the pricing of contracts and hence the profitability of the contract/project in
		commercial terms.<br>
		Often people underestimate the amount of time needed to implement projects. This is true particularly when the project
		manager is not familiar with the task to be carried out. Unexpected events or unscheduled high priority work may not be
		taken into account. Project managers also often simply fail to allow for the full complexity or potential errors and
		stuff ups, involved with a project. The 2004-2006 Wembley Stadium project in London is often used as an example,
		although there are countless others of less profile.<br>
		Time estimates are important as inputs into other techniques used to organise and structure all projects. Using this tool may lead to better deadlines for small and large web projects.
